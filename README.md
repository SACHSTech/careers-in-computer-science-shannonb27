# Artificial Intelligence Engineers: What's That Like?
## The Basics
---
### **What is an Artificial Intelligence Engineer?**

 As the name suggests, an artificial reality developer works on and assists artificial intelligence (AI) development through coding and creating AI based software. They tend to use various coding languages, examples being: Java, C++, Python, and R. In a greater sense, it can also be referred to as a coding engineer or a software developer. Although software development is large area to talk about, AI developers have specific responsibilities such as (according to LeWagon.com): 

- Answering various business challenges using AI software
- Designing, developing, implementing, and monitoring AI systems
- Explain to project managers and stakeholders the potential and limitations of AI systems
- Develop data ingest and data transformation architecture
- Be on the lookout for new AI technologies to implement within the business
- Train teams when it comes to the implementation of AI systems

### **What Kind of Program Does it Take?**
Although there are lots of programs that you can become an AI engineer from (since a lot of this field is based on experience), the University of Waterloo Computer Science Program takes the cake. The University of Waterloo is well known for their computer and Mathematics based degrees. There is a 4.3% acceptance rate for the BSC degree, meaning that this is a very competitive program, but if you are to get in, a lot of good information can be learnt from their amazing courses.

### **CO - OP Programs**
If you are applying to a CO-OP program for your post-secondary experience, there are lots of opportunities to grow your resume. For example, the University of Toronto and the University of Waterloo’s CO-OP programs are known for their respective lot of opportunities for Computer-Science and Technical Experiences in the field of interest. 

### **Internships**
Looking for jobs on [LinkedIn](https://ca.linkedin.com/), [Indeed](indeed.ca), and [Glassdoor](www.glassdoor.ca) can get you in the door for a lot of internships and different experiences. 

### **Robotics**
Being a part of a robotics team (either within a school or extra-curricularly) can give you a lot of experience with the Computer Science Field. Our own St. Augustine has a team that is heading to provincials in February of 2023.
