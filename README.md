# Artificial Intelligence Engineers: What's That Like?
## The Basics

### What is an Artificial Intelligence Engineer?

 As the name suggests, an artificial reality developer works on and assists artificial intelligence (AI) development through coding and creating AI based software. They tend to use various coding languages, examples being: Java, C++, Python, and R. In a greater sense, it can also be referred to as a coding engineer or a software developer. Although software development is large area to talk about, AI developers have specific responsibilities such as (according to LeWagon.com): 

- Answering various business challenges using AI software
- Designing, developing, implementing, and monitoring AI systems
- Explain to project managers and stakeholders the potential and limitations of AI systems
- Develop data ingest and data transformation architecture
- Be on the lookout for new AI technologies to implement within the business
- Train teams when it comes to the implementation of AI systems

### Required Responsibilities:

Within the computer science field, if you have a lot of experience with the subject at hand, you have a higher opportunity to get the job, but there are academic requirements a lot of the time. To become an AI developer, you should have graduated with a Computer Science-related degree, although getting a master's isn’t required unless you are planning on working for a very large company. 

### Required Technical Skills
- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- Neural Networks
- Natural Language Processing
- Robotics
- Visual Image Recognition
- Autonomous Driving
- Understanding of programming languages like Python, Java, Scala, and TypeScript
- Data Science
- Statistics and probability
- Data Engineering
- Exploratory data analysis

### Required Non-Technical Skills
- Emotional intelligence
- Decision making
- Problem-solving
- Critical thinking
- Creativity
- Communication skills
- Leadership skills

### Sallary Range
The majority of Artificial Intelligence Engineer salaries currently range between $129,366 (25th percentile) to $157,530 (75th percentile) with top earners (90th percentile) making $192,378 annually in Toronto. (Via [ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Artificial-Intelligence-Engineer-Salary#:~:text=While%20ZipRecruiter%20is%20seeing%20annual,annually%20across%20the%20United%20States))) The average is about $110,000 a year. As of Feb 5, 2023, the average annual pay for an Entry Level Artificial Intelligence Engineer in the United States is $112,550 a year.

## Standard Education

### What Kind of Program Does it Take?
Although there are lots of programs that you can become an AI engineer from (since a lot of this field is based on experience), the University of Waterloo Computer Science Program takes the cake. The University of Waterloo is well known for their computer and Mathematics based degrees. There is a 4.3% acceptance rate for the BSC degree, meaning that this is a very competitive program, but if you are to get in, a lot of good information can be learnt from their amazing courses. 

### Entry Requirements
For Ontario students, the University of Waterloo takes your top 6 university or mixed grade 12 courses and is expecting a low to mid 90 average. 

The prerequisite courses required for this program include:
- Advanced Functions (MHF4U)
- Calculus and Vectors (MCV4U)
- Any Grade 12 English (ex. ENG4U)
- One other 4U Course

### What Should You Expect in Your First Year?
The first year of this program consists of about equal computer science and mathematics courses. According to [the University](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/computer-science), “You'll primarily take Mathematics and Computer Science courses to give you the foundations for your upper-year classes, along with a few electives. After first year, the majority of your required courses will be Computer Science.” Some expected classes are as follows:

| Year of Study | Courses |
|---|---|
| First Year | CS 135 - Designing Functional Programs |
|  | MATH 135 - Algebra for Honours Mathematics |
|  | MATH 137 - Calculus 1 for Honours Mathematics |
|  | CS 136 - Elementary Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction |
|  | CS 136L - Tools and Techniques for Software Development |
|  | MATH 136 - Linear Algebra 1 for Honours Mathematics |
|  | MATH 138 - Calculus 2 for Honours Mathematics |
|  | Three Electives + One Communications Course |
| Upper Year (Sample) | CS 341 - Algorithms |
|  | CS 449 - Human-Computer Interaction |
|  | CS 492 - The Social Interactions of Computing |
|  | CS 486 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence |
|  |  |

### How Long Does This Degree Take?
This is a 4-year bachelor's degree, but it can be a 5-year degree if you are a part of the University of Waterloo CO-OP program.

### CO - OP Programs
If you are applying to a CO-OP program for your post-secondary experience, there are lots of opportunities to grow your resume. For example, the University of Toronto and the University of Waterloo’s CO-OP programs are known for their respective lot of opportunities for Computer-Science and Technical Experiences in the field of interest. 

### Internships
Looking for jobs on [LinkedIn](https://ca.linkedin.com/), [Indeed](indeed.ca), and [Glassdoor](www.glassdoor.ca) can get you in the door for a lot of internships and different experiences. 

### Robotics
Being a part of a robotics team (either within a school or extra-curricularly) can give you a lot of experience with the Computer Science Field. Our own St. Augustine has a team that is heading to provincials in February of 2023.

### Online Courses
There are multiple Computer and Artificial Intelligence courses online in order for you to understand more about the programming experience and more technical skills. 
For example:
- [Machine Learning at Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?irclickid=Tg0X1ZWPYxyNT9HS4HRRh3g3UkAyncXhT3TTQU0&irgwc=1&utm_medium=partners&utm_source=impact&utm_campaign=3311133&utm_content=b2c)
- [Deep Learning Specialization By Andrew Ng](https://coursera.pxf.io/c/3311133/1213620/14726?subId1=aideeplearning&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fdeep-learning&partnerpropertyid=3245039)
- [ABM Applied AI Professional Certificate](https://coursera.pxf.io/c/3311133/1213620/14726?subId1=aiibmappliedai&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fprofessional-certificates%2Fapplied-artifical-intelligence-ibm-watson-ai&partnerpropertyid=3245039)

In all of these courses, some examples of the skills covered are: 
- Master the theory of AI and deep learning, and see how it is applied in industry
- Practice in Python and TensorFlow
- Understand industry best-practices for building deep learning applications
- Get advice from deep learning experts and leaders in the field
- Be able to implement a neural network in TensorFlow
- Understand how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system and prioritise directions for reducing error
- Understand how to build and train Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and commonly-used variants such as GRUs and LSTMs

### Non - Technical Skills
In terms of non-technical skills, there are various activities you can do in terms of team building and leadership. For example, [York University](https://www.yorku.ca/scld/leadershipworkshops/) offers work principles and Leadershop workshops that can work very well with your experience in artificial intelligence. these workshops and projects can help you jump the gun for working well in a professional and technical environment.
