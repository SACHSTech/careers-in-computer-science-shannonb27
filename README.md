### What is an Artificial Intelligence Engineer?

 As the name suggests, an artificial reality developer works on and assists artificial intelligence (AI) development through coding and creating AI based software. They tend to use various coding languages, examples being: Java, C++, Python, and R. In a greater sense, it can also be referred to as a coding engineer or a software developer. Although software development is large area to talk about, AI developers have specific responsibilities such as (according to LeWagon.com): 

- Answering various business challenges using AI software
- Designing, developing, implementing, and monitoring AI systems
- Explain to project managers and stakeholders the potential and limitations of AI systems
- Develop data ingest and data transformation architecture
- Be on the lookout for new AI technologies to implement within the business
- Train teams when it comes to the implementation of AI systems

### Required Responsibilities:

Within the computer science field, if you have a lot of experience with the subject at hand, you have a higher opportunity to get the job, but there are academic requirements a lot of the time. To become an AI developer, you should have graduated with a Computer Science-related degree, although getting a master's isn’t required unless you are planning on working for a very large company. 

### Required Technical Skills
- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- Neural Networks
- Natural Language Processing
- Robotics
- Visual Image Recognition
- Autonomous Driving
- Understanding of programming languages like Python, Java, Scala, and TypeScript
- Data Science
- Statistics and probability
- Data Engineering
- Exploratory data analysis

### Required Non-Technical Skills
- Emotional intelligence
- Decision making
- Problem-solving
- Critical thinking
- Creativity
- Communication skills
- Leadership skills

### Sallary Range
The majority of Artificial Intelligence Engineer salaries currently range between $129,366 (25th percentile) to $157,530 (75th percentile) with top earners (90th percentile) making $192,378 annually in Toronto. (Via [ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Artificial-Intelligence-Engineer-Salary#:~:text=While%20ZipRecruiter%20is%20seeing%20annual,annually%20across%20the%20United%20States))) The average is about $110,000 a year. As of Feb 5, 2023, the average annual pay for an Entry Level Artificial Intelligence Engineer in the United States is $112,550 a year.

### What Kind of Program Does it Take?
Although there are lots of programs that you can become an AI engineer from (since a lot of this field is based on experience), the University of Waterloo Computer Science Program takes the cake. The University of Waterloo is well known for their computer and Mathematics based degrees. There is a 4.3% acceptance rate for the BSC degree, meaning that this is a very competitive program, but if you are to get in, a lot of good information can be learnt from their amazing courses. 

### Entry Requirements
For Ontario students, the University of Waterloo takes your top 6 university or mixed grade 12 courses and is expecting a low to mid 90 average. 

The prerequisite courses required for this program include:
- Advanced Functions (MHF4U)
- Calculus and Vectors (MCV4U)
- Any Grade 12 English (ex. ENG4U)
- One other 4U Course

### What Should You Expect in Your First Year?
The first year of this program consists of about equal computer science and mathematics courses. According to [the University](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/computer-science), “You'll primarily take Mathematics and Computer Science courses to give you the foundations for your upper-year classes, along with a few electives. After first year, the majority of your required courses will be Computer Science.” Some expected classes are as follows:

| Year of Study | Courses |
|---|---|
| First Year | CS 135 - Designing Functional Programs |
|  | MATH 135 - Algebra for Honours Mathematics |
|  | MATH 137 - Calculus 1 for Honours Mathematics |
|  | CS 136 - Elementary Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction |
|  | CS 136L - Tools and Techniques for Software Development |
|  | MATH 136 - Linear Algebra 1 for Honours Mathematics |
|  | MATH 138 - Calculus 2 for Honours Mathematics |
|  | Three Electives + One Communications Course |
| Upper Year (Sample) | CS 341 - Algorithms |
|  | CS 449 - Human-Computer Interaction |
|  | CS 492 - The Social Interactions of Computing |
|  | CS 486 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence |
